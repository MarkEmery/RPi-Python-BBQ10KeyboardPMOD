# RPi-Python-BBQ10KeyboardPMOD

CircuitPyton code to interface Arturo182's BB Q10 Keyboard PMOD over i2c.

The CircuitPython code was written to get a Raspberry Pi 4 working with the BBQ10KYB PMOD from Solder Party, enabling me to make a portable Pi 4.
The code will hopefully work with any Linux based system able to support i2c, CircuitPython and the UInput kernel module.
